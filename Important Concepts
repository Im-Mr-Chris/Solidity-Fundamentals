The Smart Contract is stored under its own address.

The Smart Contract can store an address in the variable "myAddress", which can be its own address, but can be any other
address as well.

All information on the blochain is public, so we can retrieve the balance of the address stored in the variable "myAddress"

The Smart Contract can transfer funds from his own address to another address. But it cannot transfer the funds from another
address.

Transferring Ether is fundamentally different than transferring ERC20 Tokens.

Natively, there are no String manipulation functions.

No even string comparison is natively possible.

There are libraries to work with Strings.

Strings are expensive to store and work with in Solidity.

Avoid storing Strings, use Events instead.
